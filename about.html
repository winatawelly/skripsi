        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">NEAT-Python</a> (for NEAT)</li>
            <li><a href="https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic/">Neataptic.js</a> (for Backpropagation)</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Dataset</h1>
        <p>English Premier League matches from season 14/15 to 17/18 are used as dataset, Each match contains detailed data such as player ratings, team ratings, player position, and so on. Those matches are retrieved from <a href="https://whoscored.com">whoscored.com</a></p>
        <h1>What is NEAT</h1>
        <p>Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies, or NEAT for short, is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks. For detailed info about NEAT, click <a href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?stanley:ec02">here</a></p>
        <h1>NEAT and Backpropagation</h1>
        <p>The main problem of constructing a neural network is topology. Topology of a neural network refers to the way the neurons are connected, and it is an important factor in network functioning and learning. Unfortunately this is a trial and error process. The designer will usually try many design to see which worked the best.</p>
        <p>With NEAT, topology of a neural network is no longer a problem. Using evolutionary algorithm, NEAT search for the most optimal design. NEAT also requires a fitness function, which used to determine if one network is better than the other.</p>
        <p>After NEAT process is completed, the best network produced by NEAT is going to be optimized using Backpropagation.</p>
        <h1>Experiment</h1>
        <p>After several NEAT experiments, the best features used to predict the outcome of football matches are player ratings and team ratings with configuration as follows :</p>
        <img src="./img/configuration.png" alt="">
        <p>Those features and configuration achieved 80% prediction accuracy (305/380) and 35% score accuracy (136/380).</p>
        <p>After NEAT process is completed, the next process is Backpropagation. Backpropagation is done with Neataptic.js with configuration as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>100.000 Epoch</li>
            <li>0.0001 Learning Rate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Backpropagation boosted the accuracy of network produced by NEAT from 80% (305/380) to 81% (308/380) on predicition accuracy and from 35% (136/380) to 42% (161 / 380) on score accuracy. <br>Click <a href="test_result.html">here</a> to view to full test result</p>
